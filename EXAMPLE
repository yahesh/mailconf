# mailconf works as follows:
# Each file output format is implemented in a file
# "mailconf.<x>.phs". These files are triggered by
# defining the value "file.<x>" and assigning it an
# output file name. In addition these files may
# require additional configuration parameters which
# are defined with "param.<x>.<y>" whereby ".<y>" may
# be omitted depending on the output implementation
# (e.g. when only a single configuration parameter is
# required). Export files shall warn you when a
# mandatory configuration parameter has not been set.
#
# If you do not want to create a specific file then
# just comment out the corresponding "file.<x>" line.
# The corresponding "param.<x>.<y>" can stay intact.
# They will just be ignored.
#
# By specifying a "file.<x>" more that once that file
# will be generated several times (e.g. when one file
# is needed in different locations).
